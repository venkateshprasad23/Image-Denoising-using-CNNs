# Image-Denoising-using-CNNs
Investigating DnCNN, UDnCNN and DuDnCNN architectures for Image Denoising 

## Description

The project is an attempt to understand U-Net architectures for the purpose of Image Denoising, a crucial step prior to object detection.
This project primarily investigates three architectures, namely DnCNN, uDnCNN, and DuDnCNN, which are basically variants of each other.
\
The results have been mildly curated in the JuPyter Notebook file.
